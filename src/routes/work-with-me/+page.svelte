			<h3>Why not?</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>
						I'm just an plain-old PhD student, not a faculty member that can write recommendation
						letters.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you're looking for research experiences, try to talk to some faculties first. (I can
						help to match your interests with faculty members though.)
					</li>
					<li>I can't pay you.</li>
					<li>
						The projects that I'm interested in are practical (long time to onboard) and exploratory
						(may or may not be publishable).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

			<h3>Why?</h3>
			<section>
				<ol>
					<li>I'm accessible, flexible, and happy to help.</li>
					<li>
						You didn't find a matching faculty member, want to try easier ones -- like a senior PhD.
					</li>
					<li>I like building things, which you probably do too.</li>
				</ol>
