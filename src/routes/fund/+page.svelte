	<h1>Why it's a great deal</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			I do database, especially the memory/storage subsystems, published <a
				href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j9DShRMAAAAJ">multiple papers</a
			> in top-tier conferences, worked for Google, Microsoft, and InfluxData.
		</p>
		<p>
			I write real code. I'm an active contributor to Arrow/Parquet/DataFusion. If you use these
			projects, you are likely already using my code.
		</p>
		<p>I write in Rust -- thousands Rust just for arrow-rs.</p>
		<p>
			$100k/year is enough to fully fund me, much much cheaper than a FTE with PhD degree. Need more
			flexible? See below.

	<h1>Funding tiers</h1>

	<div>
		<strong>100% of my time.</strong> I work full time as a research assistant on the project that benefits
		both your company and the research community.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		<strong>20-50% of my time.</strong> I work as a part-time intern for your company during Spring/Fall
		semesters.

	<h1>Example projects</h1>
	<div>
		General goal: the project benefits both your company and the research community.
		<br />
		<br />
		How? We make two deliverables: <strong>the system</strong> we build together, and
		<strong>the paper</strong> that publish in top-tier conference. We will build a cool and crazy system
		that is useful for your company/product. Then we tell the world how cool it is -- in a scientific
		way.

			<strong>Project 1: cloud-native storage engine.</strong>
			An infinitely scalable, low latency storage engine build purely on object storage. Aim to achieve
			1ms latency and 11 nine availability. What's more cool? It automatically tiers your data to most
			suitable storage backend -- big money saver!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Project 2: fast parquet reader for ML workloads.</strong> Love parquet but worry its
			performance on machine learning data? We will build a
			<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/5856">specialized parquet reader</a> that never
			slows you down!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Project 3: SQL query with ML power.</strong>
			Query anything with intelligence:
			<code>SELECT * FROM images WHERE color(cat) = 'rainbow';</code>
			Just register your data, and the system do the rest for you: it automatically detects the schema,
			selects the best ML model, caches the expensive computation, and more!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Project 4: Bring YOUR problem!</strong>
			I'd love to hear real world problems, and I'm open to work on various topics!
