					Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life:&nbsp<strong>
						the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of

					Act as if it is good (<a href="https://youtu.be/Usr8ODIDU-g?t=384">source</a>)
				</h4>
				<p>
					It is an act of faith to declare the world (academia?) is good, because the evidence is
					ambivalent. Am I going to act as if it is good? What will happen if I did? The answer is,
					the more you act out of the proposition that it is good, the better it gets.

					Every one is not only responsible for what he/she does, but also for everything everyone
					else does.

					Craftsmanship (<a

				</h4>
				<p>
					It’s the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work. And if you just
					tell all these other people “here’s this great idea,” then of course they can go off and
					make it happen. And the problem with that is that there’s just a tremendous amount of
					craftsmanship in between a great idea and a great product. And as you evolve that great
					idea, it changes and grows. It never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more
					as you get into the subtleties of it. And you also find there are tremendous tradeoffs
					that you have to make... Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain
					and fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want. -- Steve
					Jobs

					The best is the enemy of the good (<a href="https://jamesclear.com/quote/atomic-habits"

				</h4>
				<p>
					We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking
					action. As Voltaire once wrote, ‘The best is the enemy of the good.’
