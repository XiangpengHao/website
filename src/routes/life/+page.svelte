				Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life:&nbsp<strong>
					the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of

				Act as if it is good (<a href="https://youtu.be/Usr8ODIDU-g?t=384">source</a>)
			</h4>
			<p>
				It is an act of faith to declare the world (academia?) is good, because the evidence is
				ambivalent. Am I going to act as if it is good? What will happen if I did? The answer is,
				the more you act out of the proposition that it is good, the better it gets.

				Every one is not only responsible for what he/she does, but also for everything everyone
				else does.

				Craftsmanship (<a

			</h4>
			<p>
				It’s the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work. And if you just
				tell all these other people “here’s this great idea,” then of course they can go off and
				make it happen. And the problem with that is that there’s just a tremendous amount of
				craftsmanship in between a great idea and a great product. And as you evolve that great
				idea, it changes and grows. It never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more
				as you get into the subtleties of it. And you also find there are tremendous tradeoffs that
				you have to make... Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain and
				fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want. -- Steve Jobs
